It is the first planet in the Solar System, counting from the closest to the Sun, at a distance of only 57.9 million kilometers from the star. The first observations with a telescope date back to 1610, and Galileo Galilei made the first observations. A day on Mercury lasts 59 days on Earth. A year on Mercury lasts 88 days on Earth. Mercury's rotation speed can reach 180 thousand km/hour.</p></h2>
